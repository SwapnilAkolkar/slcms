# CodeIgniter 4 Framework Based SLCMS

## What is SLCMS?

SLCMS is utility to build the dynmic sites faster with help of inbuilt CRUD builder along with power of CodeIgniter.
This comes along with CodeIgniter pre installed. This is first tested on 15 + sites by Stitpragya Technologies. Now it is made available to public.
More information can be found at the [official site](https://slcms.stitpragya.in).

This repository holds the distributable version of the framework.
It has been built from the
[development repository](https://github.com/codeigniter4/CodeIgniter4).

The user guide corresponding to the latest version of the framework can be found
[here](https://codeigniter4.github.io/userguide/).

## Important Change with index.php

`index.php` is no longer in the root of the project! It has been moved inside the *public* folder,
for better security and separation of components.

This means that you should configure your web server to "point" to your project's *public* folder, and
not to the project root. A better practice would be to configure a virtual host to point there. A poor practice would be to point your web server to the project root and expect to enter *public/...*, as the rest of your logic and the
framework are exposed.

**Please** read the user guide for a better explanation of how CI4 works!
